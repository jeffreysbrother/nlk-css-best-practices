#Ninthlink CSS Best Practices

Since we have not yet settled on best practices regarding pre-processors or design methodologies (like BEM), the focus of this document is *plain CSS*. The following articles serve as a decent starting-point:

* [WordPress CSS coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/)
* [Structuring CSS in large projects](https://medium.com/peergrade-io/structuring-css-in-large-projects-37f1695f5ec8#.7f42jl9ke)
* [Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
