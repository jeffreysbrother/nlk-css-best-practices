#Ninthlink CSS Best Practices

Since we have not yet settled on best practices regarding pre-processors or design methodologies (like BEM), the focus of this document is *plain CSS*. The following articles serve as a decent starting-point:

* [WordPress CSS coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/)
* [Structuring CSS in large projects](https://medium.com/peergrade-io/structuring-css-in-large-projects-37f1695f5ec8#.7f42jl9ke)
* [Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

###stuff to include, maybe

* relevant class and id names
* avoid redundant code, unnecessary overrides, and an excessive number of font sizes
* liberal, but not excessive, comments (aim for increased clarity...not clutter)
* reference to JIRA ticket numbers where helpful
* updated Table of Contents
* use of visually-obvious section separators
* text editor settings (tabs/spaces, LF/CRLF, plugin for collapsing commented sections?)
* enforce use of REMS in new projects?
* include useful defaults (font size of elements, resets not included in Normalize.css)
